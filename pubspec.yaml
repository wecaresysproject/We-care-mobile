publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

# Dependencies specify other packages that your package needs in order to work.
# To automatically upgrade your package dependencies to the latest versions
# consider running `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions`. Alternatively,
# dependencies can be manually updated by changing the version numbers below to
# the latest version available on pub.dev. To see which dependencies have newer
# versions available, run `flutter pub outdated`.

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is

  # the material Icons class.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/svgs/
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images
  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package
  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Cairo # as it named in google fonts
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Cairo-Black.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Cairo-Bold.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Cairo-ExtraBold.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Cairo-ExtraLight.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Cairo-Light.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Cairo-Medium.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Cairo-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Cairo-SemiBold.ttf
    - family: Rubik # as it named in google fonts
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Rubik-Black.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Rubik-BlackItalic.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Rubik-Bold.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Rubik-ExtraBold.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Rubik-Light.ttf
